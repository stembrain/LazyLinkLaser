LazyLinkLazer
=============
Click something a few words in size feels like an attempt to make a headshot in a FPS- hard. 
Lady Lovelace's Lazy Link Lazer makes it easier to click links because you only need to click near a link instead of on it. 

Usage
-----
Check out this project then open the test.html project to try the laser.
This project has a very unpolished attempt to package the laser as a Chrome plugin for use on any webpage.

Dependencies
------------
jQuery
